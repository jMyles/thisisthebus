        <p>This was our first national Rainbow Gathering.</p>
<p>The Rainbow Gathering is a powerful display of sophistication and maturity deep in the woods.  It has wonderful mixes and contrasts: it is both solemn and boistrous, both political and universal, both wise and naive.  The organizational effort required to host, house, feed, and heal some 20,000 people is immense, but this group makes it feel like a breeze.  Everybody is involved; everybody has a stake.  The care and respect for the land is absolute; cleanup begins the moment the first gatherers arrive.  The heartsongs and circles are a profound display of human spirit, the camps and kitchens of human ingenuity.</p>
<p>It is both high-tech and primitive, both brave and meek, both ravenous and fond.  The economy of the gathering is a clever inversion of a typical capitalist system: each thing and each effort is given away freely.  The kitchens - essentially professional restaurant kitchens built in (and largely out of) the woods - give away food to hundreds each day.  Instead of starving in a competitive model, hoping against the odds that no competitor will open next door, they welcome the introduction of a nearby competing kitchen, which inevitably happens.</p>
<p>Nobody has a job at the gathering, but everybody works tirelessly.  Nobody makes any money, but everybody profits.  Nobody is bored or even has a minute to spare, but everyone is restul, peaceful, and contemplative.  It is truly something to behold, and a model for information-age economic experiementation.</p>

        <p>Moving the bus from Portland to Flagtail Creek, we stayed at a Walmart parking lot overnight and purchased some supplies.  Although Walmart isn't our favorite company, we really appreciate that they routinely afford us overnight camping at their stores across the nation, and so we're happy to give them a bit of business each time.</p>

The sound of such a huge 'om' was especially astounding.  We also enjoyed the downtime during the day - it was great to have a safe space for Notch to roam and play.  The people-watching was, of course, second-to-none.  ;-)</p>
