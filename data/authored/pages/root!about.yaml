 ### We are a traveling family of three living on our '95 skoolie.

   - Justin & Chelsea met at the NH Liberty Forum. Sparked with desire for freedom & love, they set out on a journey to learn.
   - Fibonacci was created & invited on the journey. So far the bambino has stuck around to enjoy the ride.
   - We set out full-time on the bus in Spring of 2016.


 We create off-grid technology in our bus and want to share the ways with you & the people we meet (as well as learn from ya'll).

   - The bus is as much an engineering and teaching platform as it is a home.
   - We draw from, and advocate, the use of open source technology.
   - Our bus systems operate with each other to work toward a sustainable home.
