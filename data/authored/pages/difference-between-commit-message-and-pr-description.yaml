  The rise of the Pull Request as the primary instrument of proposing changes to version-controlled
  documents has undoubtedly changed the norms of communication surrounding codebases.

  However, if you have "come of age" during the time period when Pull Requests have surged in popularity,
  they may seem to you like "the new commit."  Remember, though, that the commit is still the fundamental
  unit of contribution to a project; it's the smallest piece of media that combines an author, a time,
  a changeset, and a description (the commit message).

  The commit message remains a crucially important piece of communication for a functional team -
  especially one that is growing and wants to be able to include developers of less experience.

  Let's took at some of the fundamental differences between a commit message and a Pull Request:

  | commit message              |  Pull Requesst                                                  |
  | --------------              | ----------------                                                |
  | Part of the VCS             | A github concept                                                |
  | Forever part of the history | Can be removed or replaced when the project is forked or moved  |
