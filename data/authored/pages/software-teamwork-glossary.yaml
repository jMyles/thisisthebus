  * Integration Flow

  The process by which an idea becomes part of your product.

  * Task Regulation:  The practice of sheparding encapsulated tasks from creation to a conclusory disposition, such as 'closed', 'duplicate', or 'wontfix'.

  * Phases of deployment
  * Task Encapsulation:


  * Conclusory Dispositions:

         The input for ideas for your team is obvious - they come from the world around you.

         You put them in your integration flow, and as a result, any number of things may happen - there are many ways to conclude work on an idea.

         Conclusory Dispotions are the ends-of-the-roads that you assign to ideas once they enter the integration flow.  Your goal is to shephard every idea to a conclusory disposition.

         The three most common are "merged," "duplicate," and "wontfix."

         It's important to choose culturally-relevant possibilities as conclusory dispositions.  In some scientific fields, "wontfix" might not be a fit,
         and you might instead opt for a non-conclusory disposition, such as, "field-not-ready-yet."

  ** Staging

  ** Production

  * Version Control:  The process by which discrete implementations of ideas are added ('merged') or subtracted ('deprecated') from your *product*, *documentation*, *test suite*, or *build protocol*.

  * Resources:
    ** "Metal": The word "metal" is sometimes used to describe any piece of hardware on which execution of any portion of your product takes place.
      The term "bare metal" is used to describe servers that are in a naive configuration before the experiences fo your integration flow.
