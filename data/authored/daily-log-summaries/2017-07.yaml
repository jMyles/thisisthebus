28: Peter began the PVC frame build for the solar panel array. He also built a pull out drawer in the kitchen pantry. Myles worked on our ability to load short videos to the website, in between perfecting his Crypt of the Necrodancer finger moves. Chelsea & Notch went to the Woodstock playgrounds!
29: A weekend of bus projects commenced! While Peter brewed some k√∂lsch, jMyles & Kieran fixed the solar panel array with solder & zip ties, put two cameras up (one in the rear of the bus & one in the kitchen looking outside), wired the back half of the bus with ethernet, 12v & 5v. Chelsea organized and vaccuumed some.
30: Kieran & Gabby came over to continue the projects. Gabby re painted the front bus marquee!
31: jMyles began a project with Read the Docs. Chelsea finished up an embroidered birthday gift for her mom. But - while she & Notch walked to mail it, they parked the bike trailer outside a cafe on Gladstone and it went missing!
