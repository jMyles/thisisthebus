We are, again, pleased with the Georgia State Park system. High Falls State Park is a beautiful & well maintained campground. We initially pulled into a site after the sun had set without knowing the layout of the land. The next morning, after Justin & Fibonacci took a bike ride to the park office and back, Fibonacci took a solo ride to find a playground that they had passed on their earlier journey. So, we moved the bus to a loop with other families with children. Justin has worked a short gig, we've continued schooling ourselves on the JFK assassination and ate yummy home-cooked meals.
