15: Goodbye to Rainbow.  After a lovely morning with our Aeropress, sipping coffee with the hippies, we moved on.  We made a few stops - Best Buy for (yet another) computer, groceries, and Diesel.  Then on to Osceloa with some Rainbow friends.
19: Our friends Lele and Eliza moved on, toward the coast and the Everglades.  Hopefully we'll see them again in the PNW.
26: Our departure from West Tower.  This was a wonderful and peaceful stay in the woods.  The quiet and clear skies were serene; Steve the campground host was great.
27: From one Walmart parking lot to another.   Worked on our website for a while and caught up on emails.
