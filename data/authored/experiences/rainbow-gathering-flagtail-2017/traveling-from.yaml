  We didn't get nearly our fill, but all good things come to an end.  After passing through a near de-facto roadblock on the way out, we drove for a couple of hours and then stopped to camp in a beautiful section of woods in Deschutes National Forest just outside Sisters.

  Like the rest of the National Forest system where there isn't a Rainbow Gathering, the police presence was minimal.  Also like much of the nation's forests outside The Rainbow Gathering, much of the woods had been treated badly, including quite a lot of litter.  We found at least 4 broken beer bottles.

  Learning from the example of the gathering, we picked up hundreds of pieces of trash in order to pre- and re-naturalize our site before getting a good night's rest and returning to Portland.
