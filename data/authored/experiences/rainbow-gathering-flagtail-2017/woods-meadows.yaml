description: "The main meadow was a site of incredible care and vibrance.  On July 4th, some 15,000 people came together to pray for peace, as is the annual rainbow tradition. The sound of such a huge 'om' was especially astounding.  We also enjoyed the downtime during the day - it was great to have a safe space for Notch to roam and play.  The people-watching was, of course, second-to-none.  ;-)"
