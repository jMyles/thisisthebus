  The Everglades were nothing short of magical.  We saw all sorts of interesting wildlife in this unique ecosystem.

  #### On the water

  We got out on the water in canoes or kayaks a few times.  One of the most memorable was our Christmas canoe trip,
  during which we took to the open water on the ocean side.  We saw many hundreds of birds from dozens of species.
  As we rowed back in, we saw a group of 3 manatees engaging in some kind of group mating.  Very sensual water cows.
