  One of the motivating visions for our engineering work on the bus is a world of clean, distributed power with much smaller points of failure.  We have experienced a number of local blackouts during our travels, and there's something deeply liberating about having no cause to even notice that the power has gone out.

  To this end, of course our goal is to create a system - and to publish all of the methods to help others create a system - which provides us with all the power we need in perpetuity, without connecting to the aging power grid and without releasing additional carbon into the atmosphere.

     Achieving sustainble off-grid power consists of three different exercises:

     * Measuring and budgeting power output
     * Storing energy effectively
     * Bringing in power from a green source (in our case, PV panels)

     Our experience has suggested that this list is in order of importance.

     If you are hemorrhaging electrons and not knowing it, it doesn't really matter how well you're storing energy.
     If you can't store energy, or if you are loosing power idly from bat storage practices, your panels can't really help you.
