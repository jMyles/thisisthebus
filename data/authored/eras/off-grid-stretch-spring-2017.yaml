  One of the motivating visions for our engineering work on the bus is a world of clean, distributed energy with much smaller points of power failure.  We have experienced a number of area blackouts during our travels, and there's something deeply liberating about having no cause to even notice that the power has gone out.

  To this end, of course our goal is to create a system - and to publish all of the methods to help others create a system - which provides us with all the power we need in perpetuity, without connecting to the aging power grid and without releasing additional carbon into the atmosphere.  This 71-day stretch is our longest yet, and it seems we're getting closer each time to being ready to leave the grid forever.

     Achieving sustainble off-grid power consists of three different exercises:

     * Measuring and budgeting power consumption
     * Storing energy effectively
     * Bringing in power from a green source (in our case, PV panels)

     Our experience has suggested that this list is in order of importance.

     If you are hemorrhaging electrons and not knowing it, it doesn't really matter how well you're storing energy.
     If you can't store energy, or if you are loosing power idly from bat storage practices, your panels can't really help you.

  Measuring Our Power:

        note: We use grafana to graph the results of our power readings.  Having both real-time and historical views is crucial for effective energy budgeting.

     We keep nearly obsessive track over the electrons entering and leaving our bus.  For this purpose, we maintain and use the open source project <a href="github.com">stray_electrons</a>.  We run it on our Raspberry Pi

  Budgeting:

      One thing that distinguishes our build from most that we see is that we don't use an inverter for everyday household operations.
      We only turn our inverter on to use AC motors (coffee grinder, blender, juicer).  Other than that, we convert DC voltage
      locally to the voltage our devices need.

      We cook with propane, but everything else in our school bus home is powered by electricity.

      The device that consumes the most energy - and has the most variable power usage - is our refrigerator.  It has two independent zones.  It uses about 55 watts          when cooling a zone, and about 2w on idle.  We normally keep the fridge temperature set at 1 degree celsius.

      Naturally, on hot days, it uses more power.  Of course, hot days are often quite productive for our solar panels as well.  Hot, muggy, humid, partly-cloudy days       are the most trying in terms of budgeting fridge power.  On such days - especially if we're running low on energy - we'll turn one or both zones up to about 4          degrees celsius.  We haven't hit a desperate enough situation to turn a zone off fully, but that's an option.

      We light the bus using NeoPixel LED strips through 5v converters.  They are very energy efficient, but we have also created a set of presets which yield nice          color and lighting at reasonable power levels.  Our most consumptive preset, "Ice Cave," uses about 25 watts.  A more typical bustling-evening preset, "Papaya       Supper," uses about 20.  Our most common evening preset, a relaxing pinkish color through the bus, uses just 10.  We call it "blush."  Later at night we switch to "Lunar Berries" or "Barely Here," which use less than 5.
