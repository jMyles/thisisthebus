summary: At the end of 2015 we acquired our skoolie. While visiting friends & family into the spring months we built the beginnings of our mobile home.

description: Fibonacci emerged through Chelsea just before the summer of 2015 while we made a home in Ithaca, NY. After the birth it was clear that we wanted the ability to visit our families (in Michigan & New York) for long visits while keeping the same bedroom. The two of us were in a traveling routine before Ithaca. Justin began researching mobile life vehicles & one day found ourselves making a deal with a Pennsylvania skoolie owner.
